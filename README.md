How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.
I used the concepts taught throughout the laboratory. While I put less emphasis on the content, there really
is not much interesting to say about me so I put a lot of my hobbies to it. My design and creativity are lacking 
and abysmal, but I think I could compensate it with the fact that I relearned an entire framework. 


Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?
I used HTML tags everywhere in the code and various CSS selectors when editing divs in the code. I also used both Flexbox and grid system for formatting the contents of my divs. I put responsiveness in my buttons so they scale properly and animations so they can be noticed more easily.


What was your inspiration for the design of the website?
The inspiration is from materialize css elements. I am not good at design so I just tried to put 
technicality and uniqueness in work.



What was your approach in creating the content of the website?
I tried to put myself in front of it and let the viewer see what I really do. Which is basically just coding, listenning to music and playing games. 


How is your website creative?
It is creative because I used unique elements to display the contents. While at first glance it is not much, you could see the the creativity when you brose its background and contents. 

What did you use to deploy your website?
Netlify.
Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
That HTML and CSS could deceptively be difficult because of formatting and the number of ways
you could create or do certain tasks. It not just about the design but also the implementation on how
it will be done.

Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
I struggled with keeping up witht the sheer amount of things I could do. I guess you could say that I had difficulty keeping up with how many functions or tools I could use to achieve different outcomes, I haven't 
even started on Javascript yet so who knows how long I can last.
